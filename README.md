# Showbox Script
This is a very simple script made for my homemade line of products. Showbox script is used to turn off the tv securely with stopping media and enabling screensaver.

# How to use this
If you are interested in using this script with your own players running Kodi and supporting CEC, the installation process is simple. Just click Download zip in right top side and install it. Then you will need to set keymap.xml in your Kodi userdata folder. If you know how to edit it then just find the appropriate button and change its action to:

```RunScript(script.Showbox,toggle)```

It's just that simple and it even works.
